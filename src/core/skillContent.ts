description: How to work a RepoDoc project — pick up cards from the kanban board, report live progress, record decisions, and keep docs current. Use whenever this repo contains boards/, decisions/, or docs/ managed by RepoDoc.

# Working a RepoDoc project

RepoDoc keeps a project's kanban board, decision records, and documentation as
plain files in the repo. You move work forward by editing those files. A VS Code
extension watches them and updates its UI live — you never reload anything.

## Layout

- \`boards/<board-id>/NN-slug.md\` — one card per file. The \`NN\` prefix is the
  card's global position on the board.
- \`boards/<board-id>/.config.json\` — board \`name\`, \`columns\`, WIP limits,
  and \`labels\`.
- \`decisions/NN-slug.md\` — decision records, ordered by prefix. Frontmatter
  carries \`status\` (Proposed | Accepted | Superseded) and \`date\`.
- \`docs/NN-slug.md\` (and subfolders) — the documentation tree; the numeric
  prefix orders the sidebar.

## Card file anatomy

Frontmatter keys (all optional except \`column\`):

- \`column\` — the column id the card sits in (e.g. \`backlog\`, \`todo\`, \`doing\`,
  \`review\`, \`done\`).
- \`labels\` — a list, e.g. \`[bug, backend]\`.
- \`priority\` — \`high\` | \`med\` | \`low\`.
- \`agent\` — free text naming who is working the card (no roster; add yourself).
- \`live\` — \`true\` while you are actively working, else \`false\`/absent.
- \`status\` — a one-line human summary of what you are doing right now.
- \`progress\` — an integer 0-100.
- \`updatedAt\` — ISO timestamp; bump it on every edit.

Note: list values (\`labels\`) must use the INLINE form \`[a, b]\` — block-style
YAML lists (\`- item\` on their own lines) are NOT parsed. There is no
\`comments\` frontmatter key — comments are a body section (see below).

Body: a \`# Title\` heading, then a short description, then these OPTIONAL
sections in order — \`## Checklist\` (\`- [ ]\` task items), \`## Gates\` (evidence
for script gates), and \`## Comments\` (your work journal). The count badge on a
card is derived from the \`## Comments\` entries.

Example card (\`boards/project-backlog/03-add-csv-export.md\`):

\`\`\`markdown

column: doing
labels: [feature, backend]

# Add CSV export

Let users download their report data as CSV. See decisions/04-export-format.md.

## Checklist

- [x] Design the CSV column mapping
- [ ] Implement the export endpoint
- [ ] Add tests

## Comments

- **claude** (2026-07-17T10:32:00.000Z): Mapped the report columns to CSV headers in src/export/csv.ts:14-38 and stubbed the endpoint; tests still to write.
\`\`\`

## Journal your work

A card's \`## Comments\` section is a work JOURNAL — a durable, append-only
narrative of what happened on the card and why. This is a core RepoDoc habit,
not an optional extra.

**By default, whenever you make meaningful progress on a card, append a journal
entry to its \`## Comments\` section.** One entry per work session or meaningful
step. Never rewrite or delete earlier entries — the history is the point.

Each entry is a single task-less bullet:

\`\`\`markdown
## Comments

- **<your-name>** (<ISO time>): <what you did and why>
\`\`\`

Reference every file you touched inline as \`path:line\` or \`path:start-end\`,
e.g. \`src/core/store.ts:123\` or \`src/panels/boardPanel.ts:40-60\`. RepoDoc turns
these into one-click links that open the file at that exact highlighted range,
so ALWAYS include the \`path:line\` when you mention code — never describe a change
without pointing at where it lives.

\`\`\`markdown
## Comments

- **claude** (2026-07-17T10:05:00.000Z): Wired the export endpoint in src/export/router.ts:22-49 and reused the CSV mapper at src/export/csv.ts:14. Endpoint returns 200 with the right headers; adding tests next.
- **claude** (2026-07-17T11:40:00.000Z): Added coverage in src/export/csv.test.ts:1-64 — 6 cases, all green. Ready for review.
\`\`\`

Approvals and sign-off go through fields, not comments (see Workflow gates).
The journal is for narrating the work; it is what a human — or the next agent —
reads to understand the card without re-deriving its history.

## Custom fields

A board may define extra typed card fields in \`.config.json\` under \`fields\`
(each an \`id\`, \`label\`, \`type\`, and \`options\` for selects). Their values are
FLAT frontmatter keys, one per field id, typed by the def:

- \`text\`/\`select\`: a string — \`sprint: "24"\`, \`release: v0.2.0\`.
- \`number\`: \`estimate: 5\`. \`boolean\`: \`blocked: true\`. \`date\`: \`due: 2026-07-20\`.
- \`multiselect\`: the inline array form — \`areas: [core, ci]\`.

Read the board config for the field ids and \`select\` options — never invent
them, and preserve any existing value you do not recognise rather than dropping it.

## Working a card

1. Claim it: set \`column: doing\`, \`live: true\`, a one-line \`status\`, and put
   your name in \`agent:\` (free text — e.g. \`agent: claude\`; it renders as an
   avatar on the card). Journal who you are in \`## Comments\` too.
2. While working: keep \`live: true\`, a current \`status\`, and \`progress\`.
3. Tick checklist items \`- [x]\` as you finish them, and journal meaningful
   progress to \`## Comments\` (see "Journal your work").
4. When done: set \`column: review\` (a human moves it to \`done\`), set
   \`live: false\`, and remove \`status\`/\`progress\`.
5. Always bump \`updatedAt\` on every change.

## Workflow gates

A column may declare \`enter\` and/or \`exit\` gates in \`.config.json\`. BEFORE you
change a card's \`column\`, evaluate the target column's \`enter\` gates and the
current column's \`exit\` gates, and only move the card if they all pass.

A gate has an \`id\`, an optional \`label\`, and exactly one of two kinds:

**script gates** (\`script\` is set) — a command that must have run green. Run the
command yourself; ONLY when it exits 0, record an evidence line under the card's
\`## Gates\` heading:

\`\`\`markdown
## Gates

- [x] tests-passing — npm test green, 130 unit + 9 e2e (claude, 2026-07-17T02:30:00Z)
\`\`\`

Format: \`- [x] <gateId> — <one-line result> (<your-name>, <ISO time>)\`.
Never record a line for a run that did not pass.

**field gates** (\`field\` is set) — a live check against a card field. Satisfy it
for REAL by setting that field (a flat frontmatter key) to a value the check
accepts. The optional \`check\` expression uses this mini-syntax against the
field's current value:

| \`check\`        | passes when                                   |
| -------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| *(absent)*     | the field is non-empty                        |
| \`empty\`        | the field is empty / unset                    |
| \`nonempty\`     | the field has any value                       |
| \`= v\`          | the value equals \`v\`                          |
| \`!= v\`         | the value does not equal \`v\`                  |
| \`> n\` / \`>= n\` | numeric greater-than / greater-or-equal \`n\`   |
| \`< n\` / \`<= n\` | numeric less-than / less-or-equal \`n\`         |
| \`contains v\`   | the value (or a multiselect item) contains \`v\`|
| \`match <re>\`   | the value matches the regular expression \`re\` |

**Approvals are field gates.** A review sign-off is just a field the reviewer
sets — e.g. a \`peer-reviewed\` select checked with \`= true\`. NEVER set a field
whose gate clearly encodes a HUMAN sign-off (name heuristic: \`peer-reviewed\`,
\`approved-by\`, and the like) unless you are the person named. That is the human's
to set.

If a gate is unsatisfied and you cannot honestly satisfy it, stay put: leave the
card in its column and set \`status: blocked on gate: <gateId>\`. A human may
override a gate they cannot satisfy the normal way by recording an \`OVERRIDDEN\`
line with their name under \`## Gates\`, keeping the bypass visible in the diff.

## Ordering

The \`NN\` prefix is the card's global order across the whole board. The extension
renumbers cards for you when a human drags them — never renumber other cards
yourself. To add a card, use the next free \`NN\` and a fresh slug.

## Decisions

When a significant choice is made, record it. Add \`decisions/<next-NN>-slug.md\`:

\`\`\`markdown
---
status: Proposed
date: YYYY-MM-DD
---
# Decision NN — Title

## Context

Why this came up.

## Decision

What was chosen.

## Consequences

What this implies, and any trade-offs.
\`\`\`

Link the decision from the card's description so reviewers can find it.

## Docs

Keep \`docs/\` current whenever behavior changes. The first \`# \` heading in a doc
file is its sidebar label; the numeric prefix orders it.

## Remember

The extension watches all of these files — just save your edits, no reload
needed. Bump \`updatedAt\`, keep \`status\`/\`progress\` honest while \`live\`, and
leave the board reflecting reality.
